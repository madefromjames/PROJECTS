# Google Search Front End

This project aims to recreate a front end for Google Search, Google Image Search, and Google Advanced Search. The project uses HTML and CSS to mimic Google's interface and functionality.

## Getting Started

   - `index.html` for regular Google Search.
   - `image.html` for Google Image Search.
   - `advanced.html` for Google Advanced Search.

2. Navigation:
   - Links in the upper-right corner to switch between pages.

3. Google Search Page:
   - User can input a query, click "Google Search", and be taken to the search results page.
   - Search bar and button are centered with rounded corners.

4. Google Image Search Page:
   - Similar to Google Search Page but for image search.

5. Google Advanced Search Page:
   - Users can provide input for four search fields similar to Google's Advanced Search options.
   - Consistent CSS styling with blue "Advanced Search" button.

6. "I'm Feeling Lucky" Button:
   - On the main Google Search Page.
   - Directs users to the first Google search result for the query.

7. CSS Styling:
